Amazon Quicksight (https://quicksight.aws/) will not allow users to ingest data from DynamoDB until a future release. It can upload CSV or Excel files; ingest data from AWS data sources such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Athena, Amazon S3, and Amazon EMR (Presto and Apache Spark); or connect to databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

A similar product, Tableau (https://www.tableau.com) does allow users to connect to DynamoDB (https://www.cdata.com/kb/tech/dynamodb-odbc-tableau.rst)
